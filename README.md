<h2>Description</h2>

Simon Game is a classic memory game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game tests your memory and pattern recognition skills as you follow and repeat a sequence of colors and sounds.

<h2>How to Play</h2>

Launch the Simon Game by opening the index.html file in a web browser.
The game consists of four colored buttons: red, blue, green, and yellow.
Press the "Start" button to begin the game. Simon will play a sequence of colors by lighting up the corresponding buttons and playing sounds.
Pay close attention to the sequence of colors played by Simon.
After Simon's turn, it's your turn to repeat the sequence. Click on the buttons in the same order as Simon played them.
If you click the correct sequence, Simon will play an additional color in the next round. The game will continue to increase in difficulty as you progress.
If you make a mistake and click the wrong color, the game will end.
The game keeps track of your current score, which corresponds to the number of rounds you successfully complete.
The "Reset" button can be used to restart the game at any time.
